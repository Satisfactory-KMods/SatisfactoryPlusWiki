	"description": "Train Signals are used to direct the movement of Trains to avoid collisions and bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nPath Signals are advanced signals that are especially useful for bi-directional Railways and complex intersections. They function similarly to Block Signals but rather than occupying the entire Block, Trains can reserve a specific path through it and will only enter the Block if their path allows them to fully pass through it.\r\n\r\nCaution: Signals are directional! Trains are unable to move against this direction, so be sure to set up Signals in both directions for bi-directional Railways.",
